# RFID-Date-and-Time
This project uses Arduino with a DS3231 RTC and an MFRC522 RFID reader to write the current date and time onto a Mifare card. It can be used for access control, timestamping, and simple data storage applications, offering a practical way to log real-time information directly on RFID cards.
